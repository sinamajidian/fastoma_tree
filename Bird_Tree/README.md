# FastOMA for Bird Tree


In this tutorial we explore how to build the species tree for 360 birds.
You could also compare the inferred tree with that of NCBI and the nature paper reproducing result in the manuscript. 



# bird data set

We used following thresholds for bird dataset:
```
keep_og_treshold_species_query =   360
threshold_least_query_sepecies_in_OG = 320
kept_oma_species_num = 20
ogs_keep_number = 100
```






done!
